# Module 11 - Scrape the Surface of Mars... Web sites

## Project Overview
Using Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup gather data from a the NASA Mars web pages to assist Robin. 
Scrape, Organize, Analize and Visualize the data. 


#### Deliverables
1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Optionally export the data into a JSON file or a MongoDB database.

2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Conclusion
for this project I learned and demonstrated how to webscrape simple data, analyze it and report it out as needed. 
there is some upfront investigation work to understand where the data is contained within the HTML. this is a worthwhile investment if there are numerous similar instances of data to be gathered or if we intend to extract the data many times over some period of time (perhaps daily, etc.)
